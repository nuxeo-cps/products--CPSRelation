Introduction
============

Some graphs may use non-tansactional backends: in order to avoid
adding/removing statements in graphs when a Zope transaction is not
commited, CPSRelation uses the CPS transaction extensions.

For more information about these extensions, please refer to the
documentation at CPSCore/doc/transaction_managers.txt


Usage in CPSRelation
====================

Graphs carry a synchronous/asynchronous boolean flag that is used to
determine if statements addition/deletion should be delayed to the end of
the transaction, just before committing.
Other operations will be synchronous (clearing the graph for instance).

The transaction manager itself synchronism is ignored.

This feature is optional: some third party code may have the requirement to
add a statement *and* check if it's in the graph in the same transaction.
