Introduction
============

Some graphs may use non-transactional backends: in order to avoid
adding/removing statements in graphs when a Zope transaction is not
commited, CPSRelation uses the CPS transaction extensions.

For more information about these extensions, please refer to the
documentation at CPSCore/doc/transaction_managers.txt


Usage in CPSRelation
====================

Graphs carry a synchronous/asynchronous boolean flag that is used to chose
if statements addition/deletion should be delayed to the end of the
transaction, just before committing.
Other operations will be synchronous (like clearing the graph for
instance).

The transaction manager subscriber self-synchronism is ignored.

This feature is optional: some third party code may have the requirement to
add a statement *and* check if it's in the graph in the same transaction.
