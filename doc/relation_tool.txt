Introduction
============

The Relation Tool can manage several and different kinds of graphs
representing labeled relations between objects.

Currently, graphs supported are:

- simple IOBTrees managing relations between integer unique identifiers and
  tuples of integer unique identifiers. This is the historical relations
  management, useful to store relations between CPS documents, using their
  docid in the repository as unique integer identifiers.
- Redland graphs managing RDF graphs provided by Redland using the python
  binding.


Relation tool API
=================

The relation tool methods include the following features:

- graphs management (add/delete/get graphs)
- relations management (add/delete relations)
- graph queries (only for Redland graphs)
