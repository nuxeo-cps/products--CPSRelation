<h3>Redland Graph</h3>

<p>
  A Redland graph is an interface with a RDF graph provided by the Redland
  framework.
</p>

<p>
  It gives the opportunity to manage a Redland graph from Zope products, and
  if API is not complete enough, the actual graph can be accessed directly
  using the API provided by the Redland Python binding.
